Subject: Request for Information - IT Infrastructure Modernization

Dear Industry Partners,

The General Services Administration (GSA) is conducting market research 
for an upcoming IT infrastructure modernization project. We are seeking 
information from qualified vendors regarding their capabilities and 
proposed solutions.

Project Overview:
We are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure across multiple 
federal facilities. The project will likely include networking hardware, 
security appliances, and related professional services.

Items of Interest:
- Enterprise network switches and routers
- Firewall and security appliances  
- Wireless networking equipment
- Network monitoring and management tools
- Installation and configuration services
- Ongoing maintenance and support

We are particularly interested in solutions that provide:
• High availability and redundancy
• Strong security features
• Energy efficiency 
• Compliance with federal standards
• Cost-effective lifecycle management

Budget Estimate: 
We anticipate this project will fall in the $2-5 million range, though 
final budget allocation depends on the scope of selected solutions.

Timeline:
This RFI response period closes on June 30, 2025. We expect to issue 
a formal RFP in Q3 2025 with project execution beginning in early 2026.

Delivery Locations:
Primary locations include facilities in Washington DC, Atlanta, Kansas City, 
and Denver. Additional regional offices may be included based on final 
project scope.
