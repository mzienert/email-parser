## Technical Decisions & Tradeoffs

### ‚úÖ Implemented Decisions:
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: SQS/EventBridge for scalability (interview focus)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CDK for maintainability
- **Generic Bid Parser**: Single LLM approach for MVP
- **Basic Supplier Matching**: Fuzzy matching algorithm
- **Vercel Frontend**: Fast deployment and iteration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Acknowledged Deferrals:
- **Advanced Supplier Matching**: Vector embeddings, ML scoring (existing in-house capability noted)
- **Multiple Bid Source Parsers**: SEWP, NASA, GSA parsers (existing in-house capability noted)
- **Dead Letter Queue Implementation**: Configured but not fully implemented
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Polling vs WebSocket (existing UI framework noted)
- **Attachment OCR**: Basic text extraction only

### üìã Production Considerations:
- **Security**: VPC, encryption, access controls
- **Compliance**: Government data handling requirements
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, alerts, dashboards
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling, regional deployment
- **Integration**: Existing system API compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Bedrock Quota Limits**: Use Haiku model, implement backoff
- **SES Email Delivery**: Test with verified domain
- **CDK Deployment Issues**: Use stable construct versions
- **API Gateway CORS**: Pre-configure for Vercel domain

### Time Management:
- **Scope Creep**: Strictly adhere to MVP features
- **Learning Curve**: Use familiar patterns and examples
- **Testing Time**: Build simple tests, not comprehensive suites
- **Documentation**: Template-driven, focus on decisions
