# Email Parser Project Blueprint
## AI-Powered Government Contracting Email Intelligence System

### Project Overview
**Objective**: Build an intelligent email parsing system that extracts structured bid data using LLMs and provides smart supplier recommendations.

**Duration**: 15-17 hours  
**Approach**: Event-driven MVP with design pattern demonstrations and production-ready foundation  
**Tech Stack**: AWS CDK, SES, EventBridge, SQS, Lambda, Bedrock, DynamoDB, API Gateway, React, Vercel

**Domain Foundation**: Implementation informed by comprehensive analysis of complete government procurement document ecosystem (see [`sample_doc_analysis/`](./sample_doc_analysis/)), including email, PDF, pricing templates, and Q&A documents. This validates our Factory pattern approach for all document types and Strategy pattern for multi-document intelligence correlation.
